## Project Background

Life expectancy (LE) is a crucial metric for assessing mortality rates and is influenced by a variety of factors, including socio-economic, health, and lifestyle variables. This project utilizes machine learning models to predict LE, aiming to balance complexity and interpretability.

## Problem Statement

The project aims to identify significant determinants of life expectancy through statistical analysis and develop machine learning models to predict life expectancy on a global scale.

## Project Objectives

1. Identify significant factors influencing life expectancy using statistical techniques.
2. Construct effective models to predict life expectancy.
3. Develop an interpretable and accessible data product for non-technical users.

## Methodology

The project follows the SEMMA methodology (Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, Assess) for data mining:

### Sample

- Select a subset of data for efficient analysis without losing significant characteristics.
- Dataset: Global Health Observatory (GHO) data from the World Health Organization (WHO).

### Explore

- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, relationships, and anomalies.
- Techniques: Descriptive statistics, visualization, and correlation analysis.

### Modify

- Preprocess and transform data to ensure cleanliness and relevance.
- Handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.

### Model

- Apply machine learning models to predict life expectancy.
- Techniques: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.
- Handling Imbalanced Data: Oversampling techniques.

### Assess

- Evaluate model performance and interpretability.
- Model Fitting and Evaluation: With and without oversampling.
- Interpretation of significant factors influencing life expectancy.
